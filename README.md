# LLM-Powered Portfolio Website
This project serves as a practical validation of my research into LLM applications, demonstrating how AI can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. It showcases the potential of AI-assisted development to democratize complex technical implementations while maintaining enterprise-grade standards.
## Overview
A secure, performance-optimized portfolio website built using LLMs for development assistance. This project demonstrates how AI tools can be leveraged to implement enterprise-grade security and performance optimizations without prior web development experience.

## Technical Implementation
### Infrastructure
- Frontend: Static HTML5/CSS3
- Server: Nginx on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- CDN: Cloudflare
- Analytics: Google Analytics 4 (G-ES9YY7F3M4)

### Security Implementation
#### Access Control & Rate Limiting
- IP-based rate limiting: 10 req/s
- Zone-specific limits: 5 req/s
- Concurrent connections: 10 per IP
- ModSecurity WAF enabled

#### SSL/TLS Configuration
- Protocols: TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3
- Cipher suite: ECDHE/DHE with Perfect Forward Secrecy
- OCSP Stapling: Enabled with verification
- Session management:
  - 1d timeout
  - 50MB shared cache
  - Session tickets disabled

#### Security Headers
- HSTS: 2-year duration
- CSP: Strict configuration limiting:
  - Default-src: self, Cloudflare CDN
  - Script-src: Trusted domains only
  - Style-src: self with inline
  - Restricted image and font sources
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

#### Resource Protection
- Buffer limits:
  - Client body: 10K
  - Header: 1k
  - Max body: 8MB
  - Large headers: 4x8k
- Timeouts:
  - Client body: 12s
  - Client header: 12s
  - Keep-alive: 15s
  - Send: 10s

#### Additional Security
- CORS: Strict cross-origin policies
- Permissions Policy: Restricted feature access
- HTTP/2: Enabled
- CRIME attack prevention: Gzip disabled for IE6

### Performance Metrics
- Load time: <100ms
- Optimized asset delivery
- Efficient caching implementation
- Clean URL structure
