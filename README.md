# LLM-Powered Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project represents a practical implementation of my research into Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in real-world scenarios. Built as a personal portfolio and research platform focusing on the intersection of finance and AI, it demonstrates how AI can empower individuals with no prior coding experience to create sophisticated, secure web applications.

## Technical Implementation
### Frontend
- Static HTML5/CSS3
- Responsive design
- Optimized asset delivery
- Clean URL structure
- Optimised Mobile Version

### Server & Infrastructure
- Nginx on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Cloudflare CDN for static assets


### Security Features
- HTTPS with TLS 1.3
- Custom Nginx security configuration
- Comprehensive Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- XSS protection mechanisms
- HSTS implementation
- Resource access control
- Protected server blocks
- Optimized SSL parameters

### Performance Optimizations
- Sub 100ms load time
- Efficient caching strategy
- Optimized asset delivery
- Clean URL structure
- Minimized resource requests

## The AI-Human Collaboration Journey
Starting with zero web development knowledge, this project showcases the potential of AI-assisted coding. Using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) as my primary development environment, I leveraged the power of Large Language Models to:
- Learn web development concepts in real-time
- Generate and optimize code
- Implement robust security measures
- Create high-performance optimizations

## Development Process
The entire website was developed through an iterative dialogue with LLMs via Cursor, focusing on:
1. Security best practices implementation
2. Performance optimization
3. Clean code structure
4. Comprehensive testing
5. Continuous improvements

## Research Connection
This project serves as a practical case study in human-AI collaboration, complementing my research in LLM applications. It demonstrates how LLMs can:
- Lower barriers to entry in technical fields
- Enable implementation of complex security measures without prior expertise
- Facilitate high-performance optimization
- Guide best practices in web development

## Future Development
- Enhanced analytics integration
- Additional security layers
- Further performance optimization
- Content expansion
- Integration with financial analysis tools
