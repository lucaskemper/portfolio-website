### IN REDACTION
# LLM-Powered Portfolio Website

This project serves as a practical validation of my research into LLM applications, demonstrating how AI can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. It showcases the potential of AI-assisted development to democratize complex technical implementations while maintaining enterprise-grade standards.

## Overview
A highly secure, performance-optimized portfolio website built using LLMs for development assistance. This project demonstrates how AI tools can be leveraged to implement enterprise-grade security and performance optimizations without prior web development experience.


### UI Features
