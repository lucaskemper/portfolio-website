# LLM-Powered Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project represents a practical implementation of my research into Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in real-world scenarios. While my primary research focuses on LLMs in financial analysis, this project explores their potential in web development, demonstrating how AI can empower individuals with no prior coding experience to create sophisticated web applications.

## The AI-Human Collaboration Journey
Starting with zero web development knowledge, this project showcases the potential of AI-assisted coding. Using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) as my primary development environment, I leveraged the power of Large Language Models to:
- Learn web development concepts in real-time
- Generate and optimize code
- Implement security best practices
- Integrate advanced features like analytics and SEO

## Technical Implementation
- **Development Environment**: Cursor AI-powered IDE
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Analytics**: Enhanced Google Analytics 4
- **SEO**: Comprehensive meta-tag implementation
- **Security**: AI-assisted security measures
- **Performance**: Optimized loading and rendering

## Key Features
- Responsive design across all devices
- Enhanced analytics tracking
- Advanced SEO optimization
- Secure implementation
- Performance optimized
- Accessibility focused

## Development Process
The entire website was developed through an iterative dialogue with LLMs via Cursor. This approach allowed me to:
1. Rapidly prototype features
2. Learn web development best practices on-the-fly
3. Debug and optimize code efficiently
4. Implement complex features without prior experience

## Research Connection
This project serves as a practical case study in human-AI collaboration, complementing my research in LLM applications. It demonstrates how LLMs can:
- Lower barriers to entry in technical fields
- Accelerate learning and implementation
- Enable complex project completion with minimal prior domain knowledge

## Future Development
- Integration with my financial analysis LLM projects
- Enhanced interactive features
- Expanded content sections
- Performance optimization
- Additional analytics capabilities
