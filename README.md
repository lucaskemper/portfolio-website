### IN REDACTION
# LLM-Powered Portfolio Website
This project serves as a practical validation of my research into LLM applications, demonstrating how AI can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. It showcases the potential of AI-assisted development to democratize complex technical implementations while maintaining enterprise-grade standards.

## Overview
A secure, performance-optimized portfolio website built using LLMs for development assistance. This project demonstrates how AI tools can be leveraged to implement enterprise-grade security and performance optimizations without prior web development experience.

## Security Implementation
Lynis security scan details:

  Hardening index : 80 [################    ]
### Infrastructure Protection
- UFW, iptables, and nftables firewall implementation
- Fail2ban and CrowdSec for intrusion prevention
- Falco runtime security monitoring
- NGINX with ModSecurity WAF

### System Hardening
